This repository contains my Power BI projects and practice work. Iâ€™ve worked with DAX, Power Query Editor, and interactive visualizations to build meaningful dashboards that extract insights from raw data.

# Skills Practiced
- Data transformation using **Power Query Editor**
- Creating calculated columns and measures using **DAX**
- Building interactive dashboards with **filters, slicers, cards**
- Visual storytelling with **bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, maps, and tables**
- Data modeling and relationship management.


# Projects Included

- **Retail Store Sales Dashboard**
- **UPI Transactions Dashboard**

Both projects demonstrate the use of DAX, slicers, custom visuals, and Power Query transformations.
